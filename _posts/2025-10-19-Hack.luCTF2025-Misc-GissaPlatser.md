## Challenge: Misc - GissaPlatser suite
<br><br>

### 1. `michael`
A reverse image search of the highest peaks in the distance returns results pointing to the [Teton Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton_Range) in Wyoming, USA.

The name of the challenge helps to narrow down the search area, as the largest settlement in the area is Jackson.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [43.4836314, -110.7934631](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jackson,+WY,+USA/@43.4836314,-110.7934631,3a,75y,11.16h,82.57t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sSVfkWjTEwNkPjTmltvcTkg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.428619753276436%26panoid%3DSVfkWjTEwNkPjTmltvcTkg%26yaw%3D11.157853367839152!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x53531a58fccf7f4b:0x3d1c01cbb13a835c!8m2!3d43.4799291!4d-110.7624282!16zL20vMDExZ3Rq?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 2. `taeglichfrisch`
A reverse image search of the building on the corner focused on the sign at the top returns results pointing to a store in Susuman, Magadan Oblast, Russia.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [62.7813144, 148.1528901](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Susuman,+Magadan+Oblast,+Russia,+686314/@62.7813144,148.1528901,3a,75y,322.67h,84.22t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sqGbFrqi_k36v1Y0sW3NfvQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D5.77784920671057%26panoid%3DqGbFrqi_k36v1Y0sW3NfvQ%26yaw%3D322.66856155723445!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x59616511393e9b2f:0x4124bfff0ff513ab!8m2!3d62.7804506!4d148.1536412!16zL20vMGg2NWRi?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 3. `phishing`
A reverse image search of the lake returns results pointing to Yuno (Yunoko) Lake in Japan.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [36.7971619, 139.429062](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yuno+Lake/@36.7971619,139.429062,3a,75y,15.05h,82.22t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s3Zwo3TndTa8c27Pa_BCaTQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D7.775165400475871%26panoid%3D3Zwo3TndTa8c27Pa_BCaTQ%26yaw%3D15.048212366762124!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x601fb26b6dab487f:0x1c5b3f9a0ff55972!8m2!3d36.8001215!4d139.4243626!16s%2Fg%2F122pdfs_?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 4. `bezos`
The main clue is in the challenge name, as Jeff Bezos is associated with Amazon.

Google Street View coverage along Amazon is limited. Note the following:
- The river is around a kilometre wide, which rules out many areas of the Amazon estuary where it is much wider.
- The area is semi-developed on the riverbank where the sphere was captured, and undeveloped on the opposite side.
- The presence of a ship and smaller boats or canoes suggests some kind of a harbour.

The exact location can be found by following the river upstream from the estuary using in the `Satellite` view with `Street View` enabled.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [-3.2920818, -60.1881909](https://www.google.com/maps/place/PORTO+DE+IRANDUBA/@-3.2920818,-60.1881909,3a,75y,253.29h,76.65t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sU3NDSphhsU9VMZB2IYoqCA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D13.35023484737151%26panoid%3DU3NDSphhsU9VMZB2IYoqCA%26yaw%3D253.2936976302215!7i13312!8i6656!4m6!3m5!1s0x926bf4dd08368f31:0xa1307927d6ca814b!8m2!3d-3.2921408!4d-60.1904795!16s%2Fg%2F11c1vrm0yb?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 5. `selbstlos`
A reverse image search of the mountain in the distance returns results pointing to the Ingólfsfjall and the town of Selfoss, Iceland.

To quickly pinpoint the location, switch to `Satellite` view and look for a sharp road bend near the river.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [63.940271, -21.0039379](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Selfoss,+Iceland/@63.940271,-21.0039379,3a,75y,221.58h,77.54t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sBbf4z1vSeu4MH1a5s3gvpA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D12.456352546171416%26panoid%3DBbf4z1vSeu4MH1a5s3gvpA%26yaw%3D221.57972442996044!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x48d65fcb879909cb:0x5c9977c988b43f11!8m2!3d63.9318322!4d-20.9996925!16zL20vMGc5Xzlj?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 6. `tip`
A reverse image search focused on the lighthouse, along with the phrase `St Francis Weg`, points to Cape St. Francis, South Africa.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [-34.2085457, 24.8360782](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cape+St+Francis,+6313,+South+Africa/@-34.2085457,24.8360782,3a,60y,259.98h,80.28t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sq3plguJQbC4970yC2uSagA!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D9.721398531280997%26panoid%3Dq3plguJQbC4970yC2uSagA%26yaw%3D259.9813756197715!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x1e7a590af1e184c9:0x7b1fe730553e0837!8m2!3d-34.2092414!4d24.8311372!16zL20vMGJzNXQw?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 7. `wheniwanttogetdrunkigoto`
A general reverse image search returns results pointing to Malta. This is further confirmed by:
- The turning vehicle, with the driver and the steering wheel on the right.
- The presence of house names: St Anthony, St John, and St James' Court.
- A street sign beginning with "Triq".

The main clue to pinpoint the location lies in the challenge name. `When I want to get drunk, I go to` the bar?
One of the main cities in Malta is Żabbar. Sounds about right, particularly in some heavy accents. 

To locate it precisely, look for a short street ending in a roundabout with a statue.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [35.8768694, 14.5400212](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%C5%BBabbar,+Malta/@35.8768694,14.5400212,3a,75y,340.49h,84.91t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1swfA50DBAxaQPshXUyj7I9g!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D5.093228312794679%26panoid%3DwfA50DBAxaQPshXUyj7I9g%26yaw%3D340.4904772727204!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x130e5b48f92bcb29:0x562115c92568f22b!8m2!3d35.8771148!4d14.540596!16zL20vMDR3N2pz?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 8. `royal`
A reverse image search lottery, focused on the mountains in the distance, first returns [a clearer photo](https://www.instagram.com/p/CAwkRXvlHcJ/) of the peaks.
Using this for a subsequent reverse search leads to [another photo](https://img.restaurantguru.com/rb7a-Restaurant-Kreuz-facade-2021-09-5.jpg) on the website of a restaurant in Sennwald, Switzerland.

Dropping the GSV Pegman in Sennwald shows that the peaks are too close and too high up, suggesting the sphere was captured from a vantage point further away.

Moving the Pegman further out eventually indicates that the sphere could be somewhere in the vicinity of Vaduz, Liechtensten.

The name of the challenge also provides a clue, as the location is near Vaduz Castle, the official residence of the Liechtenstein royalty.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [47.1393063, 9.5257536](https://www.google.com/maps/@47.1393063,9.5257536,3a,75y,326.79h,80.13t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1spvrzQPwV-qkltC8odJC8Vw!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D9.868432451703711%26panoid%3DpvrzQPwV-qkltC8odJC8Vw%26yaw%3D326.794547623787!7i16384!8i8192?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
<br><br>

### 9. `hq`
A reverse image search focused on the car park building returns results pointing to a car park near Ruhr-Universität Bochum, Germany, where the event's organisers are `hq`-ed.

GSV Photo Sphere location: [51.4439813, 7.2549535](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Parkhaus+West+Ruhr-Universit%C3%A4t+Bochum/@51.4439813,7.2549535,3a,75y,250.2h,78.98t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sT4KdRTGwSMGBHE_lyIXJWg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fcb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile%26w%3D900%26h%3D600%26pitch%3D11.024511496878134%26panoid%3DT4KdRTGwSMGBHE_lyIXJWg%26yaw%3D250.2019389979488!7i16384!8i8192!4m6!3m5!1s0x47b92016a7170f09:0x9773f40e8d4e2c9b!8m2!3d51.4434839!4d7.2544753!16s%2Fg%2F11c0qgr0qt?hl=en-GB&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTAxNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
